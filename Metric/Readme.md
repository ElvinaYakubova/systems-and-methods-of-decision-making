**Metric classification algorithms**

k nearest neighbors algorithm (kNN)

k weighted nearest neighbors algorithm (kwNN)

Parzen's window method (with temp and automatic window width h)

Potential functions method (for Rectangle, Epanechnikov, Triangle, Gauss kernels) 

also used STOLP algorithm for drawing classification maps with etalon objects
